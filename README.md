# KittenStore

This is a demo project to showcase what `react-router` can do. It was created for a presentation for [React.js Meetup DUS](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Meetup-Dusseldorf/).

## Getting started

Simply install the dependencies with `npm install` and then start the dev server with `npm start`. Once the server is started open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with a browser of your choice.

## Branches and tags

To follow along with the presentation, use the `master` branch. The branch `feature/add-routing` shows the completed project.
If you got stuck at any point you can use the tags which are prefixed with `step-` to jump to a specific state step in the process of using `react-router` based on the code from the `master` branch.

## Technical background

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), it uses [Spectre.css](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre) and [IconMoo](https://icomoon.io/#icon-font).
